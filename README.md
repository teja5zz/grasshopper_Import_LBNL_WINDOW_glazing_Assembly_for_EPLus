### Description 
This file shows you how to import an LBNL WINDOW "Galzing Assembly' and assign it to windows for an EnergyPlus simulation.  This allows you to quantify the effects of window frame choices and thermal bridges as annual energy savings.
The 'Window Assembly' properties are imported from the 'EnergyPlus IDF' report file that LBNL WINDOW can output for any window assembly.
To use this file, you wil need to download and install [THERM](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/therm)
To generate WINDOW idf files of your own, you should have LBNL WINDOW installed from [here](https://windows.lbl.gov/software/window/window.html).
 Also, it is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the basics of the THERM export workflow using [this example file](http://hydrashare.github.io/hydra/viewer?owner=chriswmackey&fork=hydra_2&id=THERM_Export_Workflow).
